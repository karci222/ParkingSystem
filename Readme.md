This is part of my bachelor thesis, it is a small module containing these things:
Sample1.py - is contacting sensors and then sending the data into two databases
Sample2.py - is reading the database and then it sends the data to backendless

In order to make this work, use Sample1 and Sample2 from Raspberry module, then AdminApp from DesktopApp and create database in folder /home/pi

It is not the best thing in the world, however it is just a simple prototype.
